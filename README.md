# Unexpected MATLAB Function Behavior Due to Workspace Variable Persistence

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in MATLAB related to workspace variable management.  Specifically, the issue revolves around unexpected persistence of variables across function calls, potentially leading to incorrect results or errors.

## Bug Description

The `myFunction` function seems to operate correctly in isolation. However, when called repeatedly from within another function (`anotherFunction`), the results can be unexpected due to lingering variables from prior function executions.

## Reproduction

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the `bug.m` file in MATLAB.
3. Run the script. Observe the potentially unexpected results.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.m` file presents a solution using the `clear` function to explicitly clear variables before and/or after the execution of the problematic function. This helps to ensure that the variables from the previous function call do not interfere.
